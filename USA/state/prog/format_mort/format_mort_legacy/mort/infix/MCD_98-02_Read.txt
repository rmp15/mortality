MCD files from 1979-1997 were downloaded and infixed by Rodrigo Dias on 
October, 2005. Infix was adapted from Sandeep's infix99.do using codebooks
specific to those years. Some variables considered "duplicates" and blank
variables were dropped. For example, there are two similar variables for state,
one of which is coded through FIPS codes. State variables not coded by the 
FIPS were dropped to conserve memory space. 

Original MCD files 1968-1997 were acquired from the NBER (National Bureau of 
Economics Research) database by Rodrigo Dias. The .zip files were burned into 
a CD and is at the PIT as of October, 2005.

The files from 1998-2001 were infix(ed) by Sandeep. These files were
received from the NCHS with complete county codes. 
The 2002 file was infix(ed) by Sandeep.
